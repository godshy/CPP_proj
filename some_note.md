Note 

1. In C++ you can use all standard c functions as long as you input stdio.h
2. all sentences end with ";", don't forget it 
3. if you don't use "using namespace std", you need add std::manually for each std io
4. namespace can be used when including new cpp style header file
5. '#define' can be used in both C++ and C, but in C++ we can use some more elegant way to do it (const)
6. in C++, when initializing parameters, you can simply set it like this "int x = {} or int y(432)". First when set x
   to 0, second one set y into 432
7. numbers in float type are always double in default
8. Don't do this: Putting a string into a char type, 'char x = "P"', it includes P and '\0'
